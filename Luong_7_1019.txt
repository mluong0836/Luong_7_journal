1. Yes, I am almost done with all of my methods because I have been working and tinkering with the codes since day one of the project. 

2. On the days that we went over the art methods, I started writing my methods. For instance, I wrote drawCircles for a drawing circle method, drawRectangle to represent the
   method for drawing the rectangles for the eyes, drawSmile for the circles that will together form a large smile, and drawBackground to represent the squirly background. The image
   that I attempted to draw was a geometric face with a hypnotizing background through a for loop. I have enjoyed this project so far.

3. Yes, I noticed that there was an art method code shared in the journals because I was examining codes to help give me feedback on my personal standing of this project.

4. Yes, I have examined the sample code on github because I was trying to figure out a way to incorporate a for loop in my art project and this provided me with the answers. 

5. You would type private void drawRectangles(GraphicsContext gc) and specify the graphics context like the dimensions and the fill color, which is red.
