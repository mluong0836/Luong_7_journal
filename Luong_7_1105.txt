1. Strings are objects and are a series/sets of characters typed in. For example, 21389adsfads would be an example of a string.

2. Strings are good for allowing players to type in a response in a text based game. For instance, if you are asked if you would want to play again or no, you would have
   to type in yes or no. If yes, your game would continue playing. However, if no, yoour game would exit the main while loop.

3. Some string methods used in my guessing game includes String Yes_NO(), which will look for answer to my replay boolean. Another string method used would be String next_back()
   to tell the program if he would want to go back a stage or go to the next page in a text based adventure game for instance.

4. We are able to identify string methods by finding what the strings stated and find the parentheses clarifying the string method. For example, since strings belong to a class
   if you type the string name with a dot, you would be provided with multiple strings. So,to identify a string, find the name of the string specified like String Yes_No and then
   find Yes_No(char), which is the string method.
