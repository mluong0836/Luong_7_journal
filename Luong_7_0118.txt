1. I created a stage battling rpg game in which players fight enemies and diverge through pathways and traps to win and defeat
   the final boss, similar to final fantasy.
   
2. Some challeges that I have solved included making blocked property works, adding effeciently new objects, moving enemies, 
   animating spritesheets, enforcing prior knowledge on for loops and its wonderful uses for arraylists and classses. In addition,
   classes became easier to create as understanding objects and methods by using e._ to grap a method from a different class or
   arraylist.
   
3. I was able to create a beautiful tiledmap over the winter break. I installed the slick and lwgl programs that Mr. Davis linked
   and prepared my map beforehand. This enabled me to try newer concepts and ideas.
   
4. No, I was not able to meet the timeline because of my procrastination on minor details. I want an authentic game that is unique,
   not a game that is already built off of. Some classmates were "recreating mazes" but I found that in my interest I wanted to
   diverge from this code and create one that I felt that would satisfy my end game.I am slowly making progress, but the progress
   are huge so you won't regret waiting.
