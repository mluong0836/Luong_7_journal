1. We make a class by following the syntax described below:
        public class Explanation {
            public static void main (String[] args){
                System.out.println("This is a basic class.");
            }
        }
        
        So, you would need to specify the class through public class and the name of the class. Next, you need 
        public static void main (String[] args) {
        } to make it run. These are the requirements.
        
2. No, Donut Bismark = new Donut() is not a class constructor. This is just a way to make new objcts and initialize them.

3. We make a class with values and a class constructor by first declaring your variables and then pass the values
   to a class constructor like this:
   
        public class Orb {
            private int locationX, width, height;  //keep private so varaibles don't interfere
            private int locationY;  //get rid of static because it will set for every single orb the same
            private boolean isVisible; 
            private int dmg, hitboxX, hitboxY;
            private Image orb;
            public Shape hitbox;
            private int timer;
            private int direction;
            
            //class constructor here:
            public Orb(int x, int y) throws SlickException {
                this.isVisible = false;
                this.locationX = x;
                this.locationY = y;
                this.orb = new Image ("res/orbs/Ninja_12.png");
                this.hitbox = new Rectangle (locationX, locationY, 100, 100);
                this.timer = 0;
            }
            
3. A getter gets the values (query) of a specific variable after it is instantiated. In our game, we used getters to create 
   a time limit that would act as a timer for our many functions such weapons.
   
4. Setters set the values of the newly instantiated objects. They are responsible in setting the value to be used, such as setting
   a timer to 1000 millisconds.
   
    public void setHitboxX(int hitboxX) {
        this.hitboxX = hitboxX;
    }
    
5.An array of breakfast would be a a sset list that contains a finite amount for types of breakfast.
  For example: 
  
          Public String Breakfast[];
          
          Breakfast[1] = "Tacos";
          Breakfast[2] = "Fries";
          Breakfast[3] = "hotdogs"'
