1. Methods are functions that you input in an IDE for specific funtions. Methods are good for declaring specific functions, since using methods will allow your program to
   perform the task that you wanted it to do. For example, you can use methods, which are functions, to find primes by using the true and false boolean-boolean isPrime
   and System.out.println (prime) to track specific prime numbers.
