1. Some things that I could do to make my game more unique would be to add new elements and change the codes so that it would have a new function. For instance, instead of a main
   focused "maze" game, my game would involve a more battle and strategic gameplay that will make it more appealing to the player. This could include trying to navigate your way 
   through a battle dungeon while fighting enemies at each battle stage point. I might also make my gameplay more realistic by focusing on the authentic movements of the enemy. 
   Therefore, the boss would be harder to fight, since the player's movements would trigger different boss movements that would counter your decisive battle strategies. So, outplaying
   the boss would be a difficult task to complete; thus, making it a better appeal than defeating the enemy by jumping on them like mario.
