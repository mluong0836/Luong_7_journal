1. The purpose of the code art that I created was to create intricate designs that appeal to my senses. For instance, I founded that this project helped me enhance my core
   understanding of javaFX and the codes and methods incorporated within the main project. Furthermore, this type of code art has helped me learn new ways to incorporate 
   a for loop, drawing methods that is more advanced than processing, which we first used, and helped me learn coding and artistic techniques at the same time.

2. The purpose of creating art with code to learn is to helped enhance our understanding of javaFX. In addition, through this project, I felt that I was able to grasp more of the
   meaning of these specific codes and its functions. Furthermore, art codes has helped me learn more about the specific types of codes because visual learners have to see what 
   the codes they type does. So, by typing gc.fillRect() and seeing the new dimensions  of the rectangle, you would now know that gc.fillRect() changes the length, width, height, 
   and depth. So, art coding is good for visual learners like me.
