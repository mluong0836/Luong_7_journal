1.  I could have worked on my game more at home and check my maps as I proceeded.

2.  My problem solving process included identifying the problem, tinkering, and updating the codes until I find a solution.
    If I see that it isn't going anywhere, I would ask help frommy peers before asking Mr. Davis as last resort.
