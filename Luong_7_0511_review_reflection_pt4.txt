1. Nested for loops is a very great way to create a variety of objects, game maps, arrays, etc... Nested for loops first does
   the outer function that is intended and then goes on to the inner function. For example, in this example, netbeans or any
   Java IDE would first iterate through thet first for loop : for(int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++){};
   Then, since there is a nested for loop, it will go directly to that inner for loop and execute the code that you put in the
   inner loop : for(int j = 0; j <= board[0].length - 1; j ++){}; Once the condition is false, it will go back to the outer loop
   count i up by one and continue the same process. Thus, this would be a great way when you make a board game because the first
   loop (outer) prints out the rows while j prints out the columns in that row, then it iterates and continues the same process
   until both for loops have a false conditional; thus, creating a 2-D array if you used only two for loops nested.
