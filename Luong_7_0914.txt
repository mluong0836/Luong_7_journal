It is important for you to organize your thoughts before proceeding because 
it will help you create a better understanding of what you want to do and can 
prevent interruptions later on during your projects. For example, if you 
already have a set plan for your program's layout , it will be easier for you to create the website, since you already have an outline of what you need to include 
in your program. So, planning first is like creating a useful outline for you to start out with and then add other things that needs to be incorporated later on.
