1.  You would add a slick image by moving the image to the res folder, next create a new class if the object you are making is totally new, 
    then you would locate the image by stating Image = new Inmage(and the location /_). Finally, add the object to an arraylist
    for easier management. Add a for loop to make the items visible.
    
2.  The image is drawn in the update and ender classes. You would add the obkect to the arraylist, specify the coordinates
    of the object, and lastly make a for loop to check if it is visible and make the boolean is visiblw true.
