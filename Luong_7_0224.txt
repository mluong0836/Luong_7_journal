public class Rats {
    
    public static void main (String args []) {
        private int health;
        private int xLocation;
        private int yLocation;
        public Rats ratarmy;
        public int rats[][];
        
        public Rats(int a, int b) {
            this.health = 100;
            this.xLocation = a;
            thix.yLocation = b;
        }
        
        public void getlocation() {
            for(i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
                rats[i][i];
                ratarmy = new Rats();
          }
    }
}

2. The declaration takes place when you first declare the variables such as the x and y location. You instantiate when you 
   specified the varaibles in the constructor and called upon it by using the word "new". Such as ratarmy = new Rats();.
   
3. The two dimenional array would be int location[a][b];
