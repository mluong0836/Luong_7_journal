1. Code comments are comments that tell the user/you some key information, like what it does, about a particular code that you just typed in. For instance, if you typed a code for
   identifying prime numbers, you could add a comment to let you know/others understand what that code does. So, code comments specify what you are doing. Code comments are
   good because they serve as a brief summary/annotation of the specific codes that you just inputted in your program. As a result, you can later look back and easily read and
   fix your program, if it had any errors, without having an issue of trying to interpret what the codes that you typed do.
