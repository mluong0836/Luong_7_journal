1. A list of ten problems that I have faced when making my orbs include:

	making the orb actually appear on screen

	making the hitbox of the orb intersect the enemy and deal damage

	creating a timer that would identify the mass amount of time until the orb disappears again

	making the orb move across the screen

	enabling the orbs to appear and disappear when you press the space button

	animations to the player sprites when you press the space button, which makes the orb appear but can't move smoothly. 

	making the orb react with the block tiles so it does not go through the walls.

	making the damage method work for the orbs

	forgetting to input getters and setters

	actually now I am stuck trying to create this orb which does something else when it touches an enmemy.
