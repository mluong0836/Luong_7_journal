1. A method is a type of code that allows easier access and modification within the actual codes and allows the coder to be able to use these methods more than once. As a result, 
   we are able to easily encode specific functions within these different methods.

2. The methods that I have used in my guessing game included playagain() and playthecounter(), which were within my while loop. For instance, my playagain method is within my while
   loop, and I used this method as the main part of the game. This is why I was able to allow the players to guess numbers until they guess the magic number or when their number
   of tries, 10, runs out. In this method, I incorporated for loops to tell the player if their number is higher or lower than the magic number. In addition, my playthecounter()
   method is where I included my twist, in which the player loses if he or she runs out of tries. 

3. A while loop is continuous loop that will continue to run as long as the conditions that I verifed are all true. 

4. I used a while loop to run my guessing game as long as the player still has chances to guess the magic number, or guesses the number right. I used a boolean to check if the player
   wants to play again or stop playing. Stopplaying takes in account when the player loses or guesses the number correctly. Playagain allows the player to continue playing. I 
   used booleans to return true and fasle statements, which will then allow the player to quit or continue. In addition, I used a counter to count the number of tries and
   provide a limited amount of tries before the player lose.
