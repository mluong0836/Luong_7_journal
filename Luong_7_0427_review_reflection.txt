1. Students are encouraged to learn Computer Science because it teaches them an important skill of not memoriztion, but 
   instead on problem solving, advantages of tinkering, and provides a unique environment to hone your skills of inductive
   and deductive reasoning. For example, based on my personal experiences, I found out that Computer Science helped me identify 
   similarities that enabled me to use deductive reasoning to solve various problems. Web Design uses html while CS uses mostly 
   Java, although we sometimes broadly go over other language types such as C and assembly. thus, despite the many differences,
   there are few things that remain the same and cross interact each other to build both my coding, problem solving, and pattern
   skills. For instance, Challenge Zero in CS showed the significant effects the order of conditionals can be. Thus, when I 
   started using javascipt in web design, I too used this concept to prevent the same problems from reemerging. Thus, tinkering
   is a very important lesson that one whould learn; which is what CS is all about.
   
   
2. No doubt that students shuld understand key components, such as the basic codes to run a program, what Java is, the if and
   else if statments, for loops, etc... However, other life lessons are taught as well. For instance, CS teaches that only
   determination and willingness to sacrifice some outside time will lead to success; lessons that schools have not embed for
   teachers have always imposed strict rules and never really give students a chance to learn anything else other than that of
   the curriculum. Therefore, I think that students should learn tinkering and problem solving skills in CS, because you could
   carry this concept onward. Every job needs persistence, patience, willingness, tinkering, and problem solving though inductive
   and deductive reasoning. So, CS students will have an advantage if they learn these lessons during their time in class.
