1. By trying to create a new unique game that didn't involve timers nor a maze built game, this hindered most of my progress.
   However, through experimenting with new ideas and concepts nad going abroad, I learned new things, such as stoping animations
   in the middle of its frames, pondering over how to change blocked properties to unblock, how to specify where the player
   can go until a certain type of object is taken up, and how to make an authentic enemy; one that a player would experience
   in a final boss play. This means coding my boss to be extremely smart in its attacks, movements, etc... So, by trying 
   to accomplish these tasks, I learned more while taking more time.
