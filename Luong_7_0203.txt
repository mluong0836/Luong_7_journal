1.  Revising the code is both important and necessary because if we never revise our work, we will 
    never have any progress. Revisions is will help us learn new things, such as refactoring, declaring
    objects, linking classes to one another, etc... In addition, when you revise something, you are basically
    tweaking minor details, which can provide you with a more appealing end result, since your game might be
    able to do more when you take the time and bring all your ideas into your codes. For instance, luckily I was
    given the opportunity to revise my code because I found out that I forgot to edit the names and start menu pictures.
    Therefore, in these past few days I was able to fix these problems, learn more about the actual code as I had more 
    time analyzing it, was able to come up with a cooler dungoe game that could be the "ALPHA" verison, and was able to fix
    my grade for the beta version because of minor errors that I previously had. So, resubmitting and revising is really a 
    significant way to both boost your grade and understand/ reestablish previous iffy concepts.
