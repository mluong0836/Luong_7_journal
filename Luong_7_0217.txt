1. Arrays are used to iterate through a series of objects, items, strings, etc... that are a fixed amount. For example, in my slick2D game, I used an array to hold all of the 
   block tiled properties, since these don't change.

2. The code for an int array would involve square brackets and int. SO it would be: 

		int [] ages = {16, 18, 12};
		
3.  The code for a String array would again involve String, square brackets, the name of the array, and an optional series of strings. THis would look like this:

		String [] names = {"Micheal", "Cody", "Leon", "Joushua"};

4.  The code for a boolean array would be:
		Boolean guesses[];

5.  The code for a double array would be:
		int Length[10] width[10];

6.  You would change the first value of an int array to say 42 by specifying the numbers that are in the arrays:
		int ages[] = {42, 50, 80};
		SO, the first number in the array would be 42.
