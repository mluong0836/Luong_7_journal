1. I was part of the few that recognized the 2-D arrays from our previous Slick game and the older journals that referenced
   it. I was able to recognize this concept because I remembered answering the older journals throughly; thus, showing that 
   if you truly answer the older journals with the best of your abilties, the information that you display will always be
   engrained somewhere in your brain. So, when you need to recall the facts, all you need to do is just have a quick glimpse
   of prior projects and journals that you have written.

   Here are 10 Questions regarding the Array Assignments
   /*****************************************************/
   
   1. How do you make a 2-D array, 3-D array, and 4-D array? What do they have in common?
   
   2. Explain why the normal x and y coordinates in 2-D arrays are switched?
   
   3. How does a class constructor prepare the initialization of an object?
   
   4. Explain the significance of the "extends" syntax when calling variables or methods from other sub-classes?
   
   5. What is the difference between Player and player and when is it necessary to use them?
   
   6. How do you print out a series of chars in the arrays?
   
   7. What does each pair of square brackets in a 2-D array map[54][46] mean?
   
   8. What is object initialization and why shouldn't you use it to call variables from the object's class?
   
   9. Explain why we need getters and setters?
   
  10. How do you include several objects such as: traps, weapons, treasures, and player by using one 2-D array? In other 
      words, would you need several for loops to iterate through the coordinates of each individual item?
