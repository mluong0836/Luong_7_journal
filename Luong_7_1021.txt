1. The purpose of the code art that I created is to display an array of shapes that will allow the viewer to 
   picture a human's face with a swirl in the background that uses trigonometric functions to draw. In the end, the image
   serves to create a "hypnosis state". A different perspective is that this art project allowed me to put my artistic 
   and programming skills inter-play with one another.
