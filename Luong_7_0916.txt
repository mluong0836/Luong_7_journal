The three guiding rules/principles for this class is to tinker, help each other out, and no phones allowed. You need to tinker around because stoppers don't get anywhere. When 
 you tinker, you learn from your mistakes and fix it. You should help each other out because helping people will solidify your understanding of that particular topic.
 Therefore, helping others is really the same as helping yourself and will lead to success. Phones are not allowed because they disrupt the learning environment and
 cause interuptions in the process of learning.
