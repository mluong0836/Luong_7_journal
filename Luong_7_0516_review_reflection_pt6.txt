1. Casting is in java is the process in which you convert one type of data type into another type. For instance, converting doubles to ints is
   generally called casting, since it is converted into another data type. However, casting is then branched off into two other branches. The
   first is called Up-casting is when you convert a "higher" into a smaller or "lower" data type. This can be seen when we want double i to 
   be equal to int d. On the other hand, down-casting is when you want to convert a lower data type consumption to a larger one; thus, 
   this process involves an additional clarification process. For example, you would perform a down cast when you want int i to equal to d,
   which is a double. So, since doubles are larger than ints, this process can be seen as the opposite of the previous up-casting.
   
2. An example of up-casting is: 

    public class Upcasting {
        public static void main (String args[]) {
            
            int d = 5;
            double b;
            return b = d;
        }
    }
    
3. An example of down-casting is:

        public class Downcasting {
        public static void main (String args[]) {
            
            int d;
            double b = 5.0;
            return d = (int) b;
        }
    }
    
4. Here's a simple trick to convert a char into a String you would:

    public class Conversions {
        
        String name = "" + 'Micheal';
        
    }
    
    However, the "official code way" would be:
    
    public class Conversions {
        String name = Character.toString("Micheal");
    }
    
    5. The range of value for bytes would be between -128 to 127 bytes. Bytes are calculated through the 8 and 7 bit format in java. As a 
       result, the bytes corresspond to the multiples of these bits from 01111111 and 10000000. Thus, these values relate to how they are 
       calculated.
