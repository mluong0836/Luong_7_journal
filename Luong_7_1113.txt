1. I will use while loops in my game to run the methods that I created. Without while loops, it would be nearly impossible to code all the functions. While loops continue running 
   as long as the coditions set are true. On the other hand, using if statements only would do the function once when I really need it to repeatedly do.

2. The methods in my game will allow the player to enter different rooms of the house. As a result, players will easily transition from one room to the next when the set challenges
   are met through the use of booleans.
